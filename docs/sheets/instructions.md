{% include sheets_header.html %}

Any instructions such as what to do monthly, which source to import exchange rates from, etc., can go here. This can be useful if you need a checklist of how to enter your data without forgetting anything. I like to (try to) fill in my data monthly; longer than that and I forget the steps.
