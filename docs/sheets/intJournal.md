{% include sheets_header.html %}

Here we take all the six-column blue "journal entry" sections from each of our data entry sheets (PAYMENTS, ACMEBANK, MANUAL, and whatever other sources you add), and just stack them up, leaving plenty of hidden empty rows between them.

When you add more six-column journal entry sections, just add them here basing yourself on existing sections.

You many eventually run out of room if you have many transactions, if such is the case, unhide the hidden rows, add another 100 rows or so, and then rehide them.

These intermediate entries are later passed on to the "journal" sheet for ordering and consolidation.
