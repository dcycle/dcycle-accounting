Overview of sheets
-----
Let's head back to our [example spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I-1wbAjrl1D0MHb6M_E54xVeqQ6x9ty_XTxHQbUWGwg/edit#gid=0) and look at our sheets. Each one has a specific _raison d'Ãªtre_ which we will get into in detail.

Before looking at each sheet in detail, here are some common attributes for all sheets:

### Header, and verification

If you look at any sheet, you will see a header that looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">See https://accounting.dcycle.com</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-green">0</td>
    <td>Local verification: should always be zero</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-green">0</td>
    <td>Global verification: should always be zero</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">General description of this sheet with optional notes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="cell-black">Section 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

* The first line, "See https://accounting.dcycle.com", should be on each sheet in your document. It tells anyone who has just stumbled upon your document that it uses principles from Dcycle Accounting.
* The second line, "Local verification: should always be zero", specifically A2, should be zero if the sheet you are looking at passes automated checks. Automated "local" checks for each sheet are then carried over to the "verification" sheet; if all sheets pass verification, then your global verification should be 0 also. If any verification is not zero, it will be displayed as red, not green.
* The third line, "Global verification: should always be zero", specifically A3, should display the result from the "verification" sheet and, if it is zero (green), signifies that all sheets pass verification. If it is red (non-zero), visit the "verifications" which will tell you which sheet has a (local) error.
* The fourth line describes what's going on in the current sheet. You can also add a note if necessary.
* The fifth line is the first section of your sheet. Section headers have a black background, and there can be as many as you need per sheet.

### Colors

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-green">Bright green cells</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These are verfication cells which should be zero. If they are zero, they are displayed automatically as green and you can rest assured that checks are passing.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-red">Red cells</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These are verfication cells which are not zero, and displayed automatically as red.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-white">White cells</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Cells are white by default and can have a vareity of uses.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-light-green">Light green cells</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These are single verifications which often show up at the very last column of a sheet.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-light-blue">Light blue cells</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-dark-blue">an dark blue cells</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These are interchangeable; we have two colours here so we can distinguish different _sections_ of our sheets. These are intermediate calculations which are done automatically by the spreadsheet.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-cyan">Cyan cells</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These normally exist only on the summary tab and allow users select dates and a currency for reporting without changing any underlyind data.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="cell-yellow">Yellow cells</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Used to display warnings or bring a user's attention to something. For example, if you reporting a balance sheet in a currency other than your base, or home, currency, a warning is displayed on your balance sheet.
