This is for "exceptional" operations which do not fall into any of your data entry sheets.

In the example given, client B owed our company $100 USD at the beginning of the period, as you can see by examining the 1510-CLIENT-B account in the "charts" sheet.

Let's say our client gives us a $100 bill, and we have no automated way of tracking this in our normal data entry sheets, we can use the MANUAL sheet to enter this, as per the example given.
