{% include sheets_header.html %}

The "partners" sheet is where you put information about **your own company** and any other organizations you work with. Payments can then be recorded in the PAYMENT tab from your company to external partners, or from external partners to you (you could theorically also record payments between external partners but that would be weird).

You should put any information about organizations here such as tax numbers, etc., and make sure the column numbers row (1, 2, 3...) are always sequential.
