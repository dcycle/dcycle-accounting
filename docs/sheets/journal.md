{% include sheets_header.html %}

The journal is your complete list of transactions during the period covered by the document.

You will not edit the journal directly, it is derived from the the intermediate journal sheet (intJournal), which itself gets its data from your data entry sheets such as ACMEBANK and PAYMENTS, and whatever other data entry sheet you have.

All the columns starting in the blue section are calculated automatically.
