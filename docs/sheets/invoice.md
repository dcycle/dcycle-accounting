Translatable variables
-----

If you have partners in several languages, you might want to translate strings such as "Payment upon receipt". Your available languages as well as your translatable strings can be defined here. To see these strings in action, head to the "invoice" sheet and select different invoices in the "invoice number" dropdown, and see how the language of the invoice changes (these invoice languages are defined in the impInvoices sheet).
